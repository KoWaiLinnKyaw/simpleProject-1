            <h3>Windows 11</h3>
            <p>Windows 11 is the latest major release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, released on
                October 5, 2021. It was a free upgrade to its predecessor, Windows 10 (2015), and is available for
                any Windows 10 devices that meet the new Windows 11 system requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Windows 11 features major changes to the Windows shell influenced by the canceled Windows 10X,
                including a redesigned Start menu, the replacement of its "live tiles" with a separate "Widgets"
                panel on the taskbar, the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized and restored
                from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies inherited from Xbox Series X and Series S
                such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage on compatible hardware. Internet Explorer (IE) has been replaced
                by the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge as the default web browser, like its predecessor, Windows 10,
                and Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow
                more flexibility in software that can be distributed via the Microsoft Store and to support Android
                apps on Windows 11 (including a partnership with Amazon to make its app store available for the
                function).

            <h3>Linux</h3>
            <p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,[12] an operating
                system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds Linux is typically
                packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and
                libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux"
                in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of
                GNU software, causing some controversy.
            </p>
            <p>Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora Linux, and Ubuntu, the latter of which itself consists
                of many different distributions and modifications, including Lubuntu and Xubuntu. Commercial
                distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Desktop Linux distributions
                include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE
                Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack
                such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
                multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included
                cues for its appearance.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes,
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <<kbd>
                    img/</kbd>> and <<kbd>input/</kbd>> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
                        <<kbd>p</kbd>> and <<kbd>/p</kbd>> surround and provide information about document text and may
                                include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
                                interpret the content of the page.

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                pages that share the file and its formatting.
